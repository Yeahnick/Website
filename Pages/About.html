                &emsp;Hey! I'm Yanick, a tech enthusiast and programmer from <a style="color: rgb(77, 77, 255);">Montreal</a>. Ever since I was a kid, 
                I've been hooked on video games, I might as well have been born with a controller in my hands. 
                That passion quickly turned into curiosity about how games and software work, 
                leading me to experiment with computers at a young age. I probably spent more time 
                modding <a style="color: green;">Minecraft</a> and tinkering with <a  style="color: orange;">Windows XP</a> files rather than studying for my exams in elementary.
                <br><br>
                &emsp;Fast forward to today, I've studied Computer Science and earned some experience in programming, 
                game development, and web design. I love working on projects that bring creativity and technology together.

                    &emsp;I studied Computer Science at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cgodin.qc.ca/nos-programmes/nos-programmes-pre-universitaires/sciences-informatiques-et-mathematiques/" style="color: lightskyblue;"><u>Collège Gérald-Godin</u></a>, completing two years in a DEC program. 
                    While I struggled with general courses, I excelled in my coding classes, 
                    so instead of letting that potential go to waste, 
                    I switched to an AEC in Web and Mobile Development at the same school. There, 
                    I earned my certificate.<br><br>
                    &emsp;On top of that, I also completed a Game Development course on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/?couponCode=25BBPMXACCAGE2" style="color: plum;"><u>Udemy</u></a>, 
                    where I learned Unity and the fundamentals of building interactive games. 
                    I'm always looking to expand my skill set, whether through self-learning, experimenting with new projects, 
                    or tackling creative coding challenges. </p>
