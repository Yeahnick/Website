                As a young man, Herald Tom Norther had always been intrigued by the mysteries of death. 
                He spent countless hours studying ancient texts, poring over the writings of the great philosophers of the past, 
                and delving into dark corners of the world that most people dared not venture into. He longed to understand the nature of death, 
                to unravel its secrets and unlock its power.
            </p>  
            <p class="text">
                It was this pursuit that led Tom to experiment with the forces of the void, 
                attempting to bridge the gap between life and death. His efforts were ultimately successful, 
                but they came at a terrible cost. In his quest for knowledge, Tom had opened a portal to the Land of the Dead, 
                unleashing hordes of restless wraiths of wrath onto the world of the living. [Causing the War of Wraiths]
            </p>     
            <p class="text">
                The carnage that followed was catastrophic. Cities were overrun by the undead, 
                and countless lives were lost in the ensuing chaos. Those creatures were never meant to see the light of day. In the end, 
                Tom was blamed for the disaster and branded as a pariah by his people. He was cast out, 
                condemned to a life of exile and banished from the realm of the dead.
            </p>     
            <p class="text">
                Bereft of his former allies and cast adrift in a world he had played a hand in destroying, 
                Tom was forced to come to grips with the grim reality of his situation. He had become a means to an end, 
                a would-be necromancer playing with forces beyond his control. And now, he was left to face the consequences of his actions alone.
