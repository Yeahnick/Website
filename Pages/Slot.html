            <p>One of my projects for my mobile development class was to program a slot machine using 
                <a style="color: plum;"><u><i >Kotlin</i></u></a> with <a style="color: var(--Mint)"><u><i >Android studio</i></a></u>.
                    This was a great opportunity to learn more about mobile features such as Graphical User Interface and Saving Data. 
                    We used libraries like <u style="color: lightsalmon;"><a><i >Room</i></a></u> for local 
                    database and <u style="color: var(--ACCENT);"><a><i >Retrofit</i></a></u> with <u style="color: plum;"><a><i >Heroku</i></a></u> for Cloud. </p>

                The app has basic slot machine features like: multiple Bets, Images to represent the Wheel and returns with calculated odds. 
            </p>  
            <p>
                -Using a "Radio Button" to select different bets we detect what the player selects.
            </p>  
            <p>
                -When the player Presses "Play" we verify if they have enough funds and then it spins the wheels randomly between 9 images.

            </p>      
            <P>
                -Then a multiplier is applied to the bet if 2 of 3 images are identical and a different one if 3 are identical instead.
            </P>
            <p>
                -The password is used to add 100$ to your funs. Its only for development and is not an account related feature.
            </p>
            <p>
                -If you select the "Check Box" : "Reckless" , it will change the algorityhm and the bets and profits are increased.
            </p>
            <p>
                -We also store localy all the results and bets when clicking to play. 
            </p>

            <p>
                This project was simple and quick to create but still includes some great fundamentals like 
                saving instances so that you are keeping the same page when you leave focus.
                Proper error handling so that the app doesn't crash if certain conditions were not met.</p>
                <p>
                    Additionally learned how to emulate different devices and test as if it were on mobile.
